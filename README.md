Project's Name

This is a website which offers customised diet recipes and workouts for people. An app can also be created to make it convenient for people to gain access to the diets and workouts

<!-- Design Process -->

This website is focusing on people that would like to workout and diet at home. The exercises that will be listed are exercises that can be done at home. 

As a working adult, I would want to start working out so that I can get in shape. This website would be able to offer exercises that can be done at home so that they are able to spend minimal travelling time.
